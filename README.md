## Todo

For Infobot:

- statcalc [base, iv, level]: gives stat value given base stats, iv (out of 31), and level
- analysis [pokemon]: links Smogon analysis with sets
- compare [pokemon 1, pokemon2]: side by side analysis of base stats
- implement bulb
- add the njb ditto joke

Roadmap

- Implement a pokemon inventory system (Mongo)
- Implement spawning system
	- Probability based on BST
	- Random BS, IVs, Natures
	- Non-goal: Levels (these will be fixed to ~50 or ~80, as in Showdown)
- Implement battle system
